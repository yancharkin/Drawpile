# mkvmuxer

Extracted from libwebm version 1.0.0.27
If a prepackaged libwebm is available, it can be substituted for this bundled version.

Modifications:

 - Removed chunking (unused feature, removes dependency on mkvparser and MkvWriter)
 - Removed Segmet::CopyAndMoveCuesBeforeClusters (unused feature, removed dependency on mkvparser)
 - Removed unneeded `#include "mkvwriter.h"` from mkvmuxerutil.cc
